              One of Observable’s motivating principles is to listen to and
              learn from its passionate and fast-growing community.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Hundreds of our community members generously participated in two
              research surveys about data analysis and visualization over the
              past year. Here’s what we learned.
            </p>
            <h2>Data is exploding, for everyone</h2>
            <p>
              With the explosive growth in online technologies, services and
              information,
              <a
                href="https://seedscientific.com/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/"
                >data is overwhelming</a
              >
              for all of us. Making sense of it is the biggest issue facing our
              connected world. For businesses, there is an urgent need for
              cross-functional teams to gain data-driven insights quickly to
              inform business decisions.
            </p>
            <h2>The data visualization community is growing</h2>
            <p>
              Observable’s survey data shows accelerated interest and growth in
              data visualization. This is confirmed by other industry observers:
              Fortune Business Insights in 2020 estimated a market size of
              $8.85B as of 2019 and projected growth (CAGR) of 10.2% through
              2027.
            </p>
            <p>
              This growth in business investment and community size makes it
              clear that businesses are prioritizing tool investments for their
              teams to work with data, and gain data-driven insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our surveys show that working with data is no longer something
              that primarily specialists do; working with data is increasingly
              becoming a critical skill for many jobs. More people are investing
              in their own data-centric skills to meet the rising business
              needs, and to excel in their chosen professions.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Data Practitioners: data specialists and their collaborators
            </h2>
            <p>
              The people investing in their data skills are in different job
              functions. They analyze data, share insights and communicate with
              each other:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data scientists</li>
              <li>Data engineers</li>
              <li>Data architects</li>
              <li>Business and financial analysts</li>
              <li>Data visualization (dataviz) creators</li>
              <li>Business Intelligence / Operational dashboard developers</li>
              <li>
                Those who collaborate with the above, such as product managers,
                team leads, and decision makers
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Observable uses the term <em>data practitioners</em> as an
              inclusive identity covering all of the people who work together on
              data.

              Note that for the “hobbyist” category, deeper inspection showed
              that these people were in fact doing data-work, including data
              exploration, data analysis, data visualizations and dashboard
              creation, etc. They self-identified as hobbyists because they were
              doing this work in a personal capacity and not as part of their
              official job. This further strengthens the hypothesis on the
              broadening group of data practitioners honing their data-related
              skills.

              More practitioners are entering the field to match industry demand
            </h2>
            <p>
              We're seeing that <em>more and diverse</em> practitioners are
              entering the field and beginning to sharpen their skills with
              languages and libraries for more complex data visualizations. This
              growth of the field may be fostered by easier access to learning
              materials outside of traditional learning environments, tools to
              break down silos and allow various skill-sets to participate and
              drive data visualization creation, and the sprouting of digital
              communities for collaboration and troubleshooting.
